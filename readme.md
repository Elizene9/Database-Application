This window will have three textfields; one to add the name, one to add a serial number, and one to add a
value. Your value must be a valid numerical value; your
name must be between 2 and 256 characters long inclusive; and
your serial number must be ten characters long with only
numbers and letters. Upon typing each item's info press enter
to temporarily save that info. Once you have created all
the item information, press the add button to add the item.

from a dropdown menu; and you enter your **valid** info
in the text fields; then press edit to save that new 
information. To exit this window press done.

To load a list from a file press load from the options
menu; you will be able to choose which file you would like

will be displayed upon pressing these options. If you
just want to view your list at any point press the
giant DISPLAY button at the bottom right of the front
page. It will display your list alphabetically.

To remove an item from your inventory, select remove
an item from the options menu dropdown. This remove
menu item **MUST** be selected before you can remove items
from your inventory. Once it is pressed you can select
the permanently remove item dropdown on the right.
The items will be displayed here with a format of
name +":" + serial number. **Once an item is selected
it is permanently removed**
